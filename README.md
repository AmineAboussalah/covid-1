# Experiments
The experiments and running them are explained in detail in their own readme. They are just briefly described here.

## [SEIR](SEIR/)
SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) models are a class of compartmental models in epidemiology. Our experiment is on a SEI<sup>3</sup>R variant.

## [FRED](FRED/)
FRED (A Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics) is an open source agent-based simulator for epidemiological dynamics. It simulates each person separately with its own properties. The spread of a disease with its own user-defined parameters is then simulated through interaction of the simulated people.
